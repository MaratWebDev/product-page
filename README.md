# product-page

This product detail page I created using CSS, SaSS, jQuery, JS, HTML5.  
I used Gulp with SaSS and watch dependencies.
Timeline: it took me around 1 full day including a couple of hours for setting up the dev environment. 
Another 2 hours for creating HTML structure and preparation. And the rest time for styling and functionality.
I used Adobe Photoshop and Gimp to get layers out of the .psd file. Get data about typefaces etc used in the visual demo. And on the base of this data planning how to structure in HTML.
I added reset.scss to clear browser styles and reduce inconsistency.
During image optimisation, I've noticed dimensions of one of the images had to be corrected.
I used CSS Grid for creating a layout. Used CSS for creating symbols in breadcrumbs. And for the creating colour circles in product description area.
JS implemented was for showing span element on the hover, using jQuery.
Separation of the footer banner's text I achieved by specifying width 30%, rather than using <br>(break in line).
Similar colour overlay on the banner image in the footer I achieved by using CSS blend modes.
The site is responsive for Desktop and tablet view. (based on given visual).
